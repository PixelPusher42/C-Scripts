Item 1:
2 files running simultaneously to make the "NTU HOTEL ROOM RESERVATION PROGRAM". This program is able to:
- list occupied rooms in the hotel
- assign guest IDs to room
- remove guest IDs from room
- find matching room based on guest IDs

This is built with knowledge of basic data structures and self-declared functions. This is meant to be a primitive code for a non-complex system.
